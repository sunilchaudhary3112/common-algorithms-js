# Common Algorithms [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/JHM90/common-algorithms.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/JHM90/common-algorithms)

Commonly used algorithms implemented in JavaScript with Mocha/Chai testing.

###Algorithms Included

* [Selection Sort](https://github.com/JHM90/common-algorithms/blob/master/algorithms/selectionSort.js)
* [Bubble Sort](https://github.com/JHM90/common-algorithms/blob/master/algorithms/bubbleSort.js)

###Testing

To test the algorithms first install the node dependencies via npm using this command in your terminal while navigated within this project's root directory:

`npm install`

Once the necessary dependencies have been installed enter the command:

`npm test`

to run the tests.  This repository uses [Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org/JHM90/common-algorithms) for deployment testing, these tests are performed using Node versions 5.1x and 4.2x.
