# Common Algorithms in JavaScript [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/JHM90/common-algorithms.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/JHM90/common-algorithms)

Commonly used algorithms implemented in JavaScript with [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/)/[Chai](http://chaijs.com/) testing.

* [Selection Sort](https://github.com/JHM90/common-algorithms/blob/master/algorithms/selectionSort.js)
* [Bubble Sort](https://github.com/JHM90/common-algorithms/blob/master/algorithms/bubbleSort.js)
* [Linear Search](https://github.com/JHM90/common-algorithms/blob/master/algorithms/linearSearch.js)
* [Brute Force String Match](https://github.com/JHM90/common-algorithms/blob/master/algorithms/bruteForceStringMatch.js)
* [Merge Sort](https://github.com/JHM90/common-algorithms/blob/master/algorithms/mergeSort.js)
* [Quick Sort](https://github.com/JHM90/common-algorithms/blob/master/algorithms/quickSort.js)

###Testing

To run the tests yourself you'll need to download the project and install its node module dependencies via [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/).  So, if you haven't already installed [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and npm for use on your command line hop over to their website and follow the download and installation instructions.  Once you have Node.js and npm installed, clone the project onto your computer using the following command:

`git clone https://github.com/JHM90/common-algorithms-js.git`

Once it's downloaded use the following command to navigate to the project's root directory:

`cd common-algorithms-js`

Next you'll install the project's node module dependencies from npm, enter the command:

`npm install`

That'll install everything you're going to need to run the tests.  Now enter the following command to run the tests:

`npm test`

This repository uses [Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org/JHM90/common-algorithms) for deployment testing on Node.js versions 5.1x and 4.2x.
