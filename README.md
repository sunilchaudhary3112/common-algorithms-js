# Common Algorithms [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/JHM90/common-algorithms.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/JHM90/common-algorithms)

Commonly used algorithms implemented in JavaScript with [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/)/[Chai](http://chaijs.com/) testing.

* [Selection Sort](https://github.com/JHM90/common-algorithms/blob/master/algorithms/selectionSort.js)
* [Bubble Sort](https://github.com/JHM90/common-algorithms/blob/master/algorithms/bubbleSort.js)
* [Linear Search](https://github.com/JHM90/common-algorithms/blob/master/algorithms/linearSearch.js)
* [Brute Force String Match](https://github.com/JHM90/common-algorithms/blob/master/algorithms/bruteForceStringMatch.js)

###Testing

To test the algorithms first install the node dependencies via npm using this command in your terminal while navigated within this project's root directory:

`npm install`

Once the necessary dependencies have been installed enter the command:

`npm test`

to run the tests.  This repository uses [Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org/JHM90/common-algorithms) for deployment testing, these tests are performed on Node.js versions 5.1x and 4.2x.
