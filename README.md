# Common Algorithms in JavaScript [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/JHM90/common-algorithms-js.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/JHM90/common-algorithms-js)

Commonly used algorithms implemented in JavaScript with [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/)/[Chai](http://chaijs.com/) testing.

* [Selection Sort](https://github.com/JHM90/common-algorithms/blob/master/algorithms/selectionSort.js)
* [Bubble Sort](https://github.com/JHM90/common-algorithms/blob/master/algorithms/bubbleSort.js)
* [Linear Search](https://github.com/JHM90/common-algorithms/blob/master/algorithms/linearSearch.js)
* [Brute Force String Match](https://github.com/JHM90/common-algorithms/blob/master/algorithms/bruteForceStringMatch.js)
* [Merge Sort](https://github.com/JHM90/common-algorithms/blob/master/algorithms/mergeSort.js)
* [Quick Sort](https://github.com/JHM90/common-algorithms/blob/master/algorithms/quickSort.js)

###Testing

To run the tests yourself you'll need to download the project and install its node module dependencies via [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/).  So, if you haven't already installed [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and npm for use on your command line hop over to the Node.js website and follow their download and installation instructions.  Once you have Node.js and npm installed, clone the project onto your computer using the following command in your terminal/command prompt/console:

`git clone https://github.com/JHM90/common-algorithms-js.git`

(Just in case you haven't already installed [Git](https://git-scm.com/), do so by following the  installation instructions [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git), then enter the previous command again once it's installed.)  Once you've downloaded the project use the following command to navigate to the project's root directory:

`cd common-algorithms-js`

Next you'll install the project's node module dependencies from npm.  Do so by entering this command:

`npm install`

Once everything has been installed you'll be ready to run the tests.  Enter the following command to run them:

`npm test`

This repository uses [Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org/JHM90/common-algorithms-js) for deployment testing on Node.js versions 5.1x and 4.2x.
